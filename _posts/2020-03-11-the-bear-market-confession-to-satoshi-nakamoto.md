We may have a thousand lifestyles but not a thousand types of lives. We are able to see the world through our screens, but somehow manage to feel monotonous. We hold our different opinions and reasons and cannot help but think: “What am I? Is there anyone out there that can stand with me?”

#### Winter is coming, let us stay together

In the depression where winter is approaching and work is always dragging into late night and overtime, hope is covered in a thick fog.

Depression in this industry comes suddenly, but fluctuations in highs and lows are natural.

As complicated the world is, it is important to stick to your path. Do what you want, make your own friends, make money your own way, and await for the real changes to come.

If you seek common belief and a partner to warm up in this chilling season, why not visit BunnyPub for a clean and reliable blockchain environment?

BunnyPub showcases a rich blockchain lifestyle that can help you find peers in the sea of people.

#### Nakamoto’s Land of Pure

BitRabbit has pioneered the first pure land for blockchain.

People that know blockchain would be familiar with Bitcoin first, and Nakamoto is the mysterious and powerful being behind Bitcoin. Since the birth of Bitcoin 10 years ago, his identity is still a mystery up to this day.

When you enter BunnyPub, you can be able to meet the right person by just a signal or the meet of eyes.

#### One Forum, one attitude

From planning to the prototype to the official launch took our operation team one month. Even so, not only does BunnyPub have over 20,000 registered users, the registered users on BitRabbit exchange have also exceeded 100,000!

Why the name BunnyPub? We hope to create a relaxed and active environment like a pub for the bunnies of BitRabbit where all can gather together regardless of identity for open discussion.

#### You can choose what you want to see

Cryptocurrency news: Rampage the battlegrounds and become the next cryptocurrency god!

Coin Academy: Discover the most investment worthy blockchain!

Currency Circle Stories: Dip in and out of the drama, you are the spotlight!

BEE DAPP player: The number one player is you!

Spa area: Share a pool with Sasaki Hiroshi!

##### One of the few forums that have crypto-tipping service

Compared with the change in production relations brought about by blockchain technology, the token economy system will be more beneficial to the construction of ecological projects.

The existing blockchain communities rarely use blockchain cryptocurrencies directly. Those that do, such as Steemit, have limitations to their own currency. BunnyHub not only circulates its own platform currency, but also uses the cryptocurrency supported by various BitRabbit wallet services to better help project parties build their own communities. For ordinary users, by participating in the forum you have the chance to be rewarded with cryptocurrency that is liquid on the market.

Project parties often use Wechat or TG for community establishment, but content is difficult to precipitate. We provide tools and methods to build community and community culture. Regardless of a bull or bear market, there will always be reason to visit.

#### We conclude with a poem by John Donne "No one is an island"

No one is an island and can be self-sufficient.
Everyone is a piece of the continent, a part of the whole.

If the sea washes land away, the land shrinks.
Like a strait missing a corner,
Like your friend or yourself
The loss of territory.

Anyone’s death is my loss, Because I am a member of humanity.

Therefore, Don't ask who the death knell is for, It will sound for you.

<strong>It is a pleasure to know you in these depressing times, let me guide and give you courage, and rejoice in our meeting.</strong>
