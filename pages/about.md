每当听到身边人能够大胆地表达生活看法，我就很高兴，哪怕他们是纯吐槽我都支持。

因为在我看来，年轻的时候去经历是非善恶是很重要的教育，越早去表达，去与世界碰撞，去将自己心胸在磨砺中去锻炼，就越早真正领悟什么叫真正的云淡风轻，什么是自在，习得了率真，也领悟了明白，呈现出来的就是一个有完整独立人格，有趣味有思想有品位的灵魂和大脑。

尴尬的是，很多人老觉得有趣的灵魂和大脑是一个遥远的事，觉得追求这些特装，其实一个人只要对自己足够坦诚的，好的坏的都接受，拥有自己的爱好，接受世界的多元，这就是一个有趣的人了。

所谓有趣无非就是自己过着舒服，自在，这样你呈现给别人的状态也是喜人的，哪怕你就呆在自己的世界里，也是自在得意的。

对自己诚实说来在我们这个环境里特别稀少，见过很多光鲜亮丽的人，表面看着风和日丽岁月静，可一两句直击心灵的话就容易动摇，这样的人无一不是在日后撑起来的坚强日子里濒临崩溃，正如浓妆艳抹下的素颜，实则面容憔悴。

但似乎人们没有兴趣去剔除自己的麻木，看似精挑细选的人们，却对最珍贵的东西视如无物，从未为自己的内心有过一次拼搏与争取。

It is what it is.

## Why I choose to be a freelance writer

Hi，my name is Lisa. I am a freelance writer from Shanghai, China.
I used to work in Singapore for more than ten years, and happened to be a freelance writer for only few years.

I like being at the center of events, being free and enjoying every moment. I am able to write accurate and conversational stories that follow the facts and reference video and graphics.

When I was a child, dreaming about being a writer, I believed that my career would be determined by my passions. I thought that whatever made me the happiest would be the way I spent my days.

By the time I got to high school, I was considering business management or marketing—I thought that a substantial paycheck would be the most influential factor in my occupational pursuits.

Little did I know that choosing an occupation involved so much more than just passion and paychecks.

I've considered being a freelance writer after graduation from University, but I have had many people tell me why it is not a good idea. Freelance writing is often considered a risky career for many reasons. They pay isn't good enough, the lack of benefits, establishing clients isn't easy, etc. These are all valid reasons to be hesitant about freelance writing.

After college, I found my way into data analysis with a midsize alcohol distribution company. The job came with paid vacation time, healthcare benefits, and a generous retirement package.

Then, during one of my more dull moments at work, I wrote an email to an editor at a enomonic and life magazine that I read religiously—and I was invited to contribute my first piece about stylish motherhood.

However, the more I have done research, especially in 2017, freelance writers are needed now more than ever because of the digital age we are living in.

When I left my full time job , I thought I would finally be able to devote myself to simply writing good stories rather than attending unnecessarily lengthy editorial team meetings, lunching with potential clients, subediting content, selecting photos, checking and replying to emails, guiding junior writers with stories and designers with layout.

This was not the case at all. As a freelance writer, I still have deal with most of the responsibilities of a staff writer. In addition, I also need to read contracts, research publications to approach, brainstorm for story ideas and pitch them, create and send proposals, quotations and invoices, keep track of my income and expenditures, file receipts for tax deductions, and constantly think about how I can grow my business. Phew! Here’s what I do to ensure administrative work does not bog me down.

It’s not always simple, but the payoff is a job that I love and work-life balance that would never be possible in a traditional work arrangement. In the end, it wasn’t all about passion and paychecks. However, I realized that if you have the two, it only takes a little more effort to figure out everything else.
