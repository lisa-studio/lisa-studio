## Why I choose to be a freelance writer

Hi，my name is Lisa. I am a freelance writer from Shanghai, China.
I used to work in Singapore for more than ten years, and happened to be a freelance writer for only few years.

I like being at the center of events, being free and enjoying every moment. I am able to write accurate and conversational stories that follow the facts and reference video and graphics.

When I was a child, dreaming about being a writer, I believed that my career would be determined by my passions. I thought that whatever made me the happiest would be the way I spent my days.

By the time I got to high school, I was considering business management or marketing—I thought that a substantial paycheck would be the most influential factor in my occupational pursuits.

Little did I know that choosing an occupation involved so much more than just passion and paychecks.

I've considered being a freelance writer after graduation from University, but I have had many people tell me why it is not a good idea. Freelance writing is often considered a risky career for many reasons. They pay isn't good enough, the lack of benefits, establishing clients isn't easy, etc. These are all valid reasons to be hesitant about freelance writing.

After college, I found my way into data analysis with a midsize alcohol distribution company. The job came with paid vacation time, healthcare benefits, and a generous retirement package.

Then, during one of my more dull moments at work, I wrote an email to an editor at a enomonic and life magazine that I read religiously—and I was invited to contribute my first piece about stylish motherhood.

However, the more I have done research, especially in 2017, freelance writers are needed now more than ever because of the digital age we are living in.

When I left my full time job , I thought I would finally be able to devote myself to simply writing good stories rather than attending unnecessarily lengthy editorial team meetings, lunching with potential clients, subediting content, selecting photos, checking and replying to emails, guiding junior writers with stories and designers with layout.

This was not the case at all. As a freelance writer, I still have deal with most of the responsibilities of a staff writer. In addition, I also need to read contracts, research publications to approach, brainstorm for story ideas and pitch them, create and send proposals, quotations and invoices, keep track of my income and expenditures, file receipts for tax deductions, and constantly think about how I can grow my business. Phew! Here’s what I do to ensure administrative work does not bog me down.

It’s not always simple, but the payoff is a job that I love and work-life balance that would never be possible in a traditional work arrangement. In the end, it wasn’t all about passion and paychecks. However, I realized that if you have the two, it only takes a little more effort to figure out everything else.
